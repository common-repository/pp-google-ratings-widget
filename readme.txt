Google Ratings Widget, shows ratings and reviews of an Google Place, increasing user confidence and SEO with rich snippets.

== Description ==
Google Ratings Widget, the most powerful widget for displaying reviews and ratings, depending on your license (Free or Pro), it also improves your SEO and the confidence of your customers. The plugin is dependent on the Google Places API, but when you fetch the place the reviews and ratings are saved to the WordPress Database in a table named 'pgrw', meaning after that it is not dependent on Google, in the Free version the ratings are only updated once meaning you would have to manually update them, but in the Pro version, they update automatically once a day, due to the limitation of the api.

The Pro Version contains many more features, to improve your users confidence and the professionality of your website, so [Upgrade Now](https://platinumplugins.com/google-ratings-widget)
